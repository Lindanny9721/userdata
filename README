Planner: User Creation & Event Attendance

This project is a part of a capstone application designed to help users plan hangout events with friends, powered by the Google Maps API. The primary features include user registration, logging in, and choosing whether or not they will be attending various planned events. The app allows users to create and manage accounts, browse events, and RSVP to events based on their preferences.
